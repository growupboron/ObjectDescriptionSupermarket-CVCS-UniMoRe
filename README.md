If you want to check th results of the tes script, just run test_dataset.py script:
```bash
python test_classifier.py
```
If you have time to waste and want to train the model run:
```bash
python train_classifier.py
```
<h2> Dataset </h2>

I have been creating the custom dataset classes for the following datasets:
- Freiburg Groceries Dataset

- Shelves+Supermarket

<h2> We need to</h2>
- Upload the remaining datasets in the GitHub repository(SKU-110K)
