# Object Description Supermarket
<!--- This is the readme file of the following computer vision and NLP project:"A Complete vision and cognitive pipeline for a practical case
Given images containing different objects in a shelf, build a pipeline which:
•Detects objects in the scene
•Identifies object positions and their spatial relationships in the 3D space, like “A is behind B”, “A is under B”, “A is next
to B”, etc. (e.g. via homography, camera calibration or graph-based spatial reasoning)
•Generates a natural language description of the scene and a quantitative description of the objects which also exploits
the knowledge of their relative spatial positions (e.g. via a rule-based template filling or with a trainable language
model), e.g. “there are twelve similar red objects at the highest level of the shelf" -->

## The project is divided into 3 parts: 


## 1. Object Detection and Classification:

### 1.1. Object Detection
    




## 2. Object Positioning

## 3. Object Description
