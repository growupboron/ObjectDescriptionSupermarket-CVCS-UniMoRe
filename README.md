<h2> CVCS course project </h2>

If you want to check th results of the tes script, just run test_dataset.py script:
```bash
python test_dataset.py
```
If you have time to waste and want to train the model, delete the model.pth file and run again the script mentioned above.

<h2> Dataset </h2>

I have been creating the custom dataset classes for the following datasets:
- Freiburg Groceries Dataset
- GroceryStoreDataset

<h2> We need to: (just for the milestone)</h2>
- Upload the remaining datasets in the GitHub repository
- Create the custom dataset classes for the remaining datasets
- Test those classes
- Maybe start working on the object detection part
